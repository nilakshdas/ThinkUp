Twitter Saved Searches
======================

ThinkUp can capture search results for a keyword or hashtag. In Settings > Twitter, next to an authorized user,
click on "Saved searches." On the Saved Searches page, enter your keyword or hashtag and click on "Save search."

Next time it updates your data, ThinkUp will capture tweets which contain that keyword or hashtag.
